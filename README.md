# SkipMap Implementation in Java 🗺️🔍

## Overview
This project implements a **Skip Map** (a variation of a Skip List) in Java.  
Skip Maps allow fast lookups, insertions, and deletions in `O(log n)` time.

## 🚀 Features
- Implements a **Skip Map** using Java generics (`<K, V>`).
- Uses **randomized skipping** to improve lookup performance.
- Supports **insert, delete, and find operations** similar to `TreeMap`.
- Built on top of a **custom LinkedMap**.
